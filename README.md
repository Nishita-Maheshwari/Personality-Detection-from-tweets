# About the Project:

Personality is an important parameter as it differentiates various individuals from one another. Personality prediction is an 
evergreen area of research. Predicting personality with the help of data through social media is a promising approach as this
method does not require any questionnaires to be filled by users thus reducing time and increasing credibility. Thus having
knowledge of personality is an interesting domain for researchers to work on. Predicting personality has many applications in
real world. Use of social media is increasing day by day. Huge amount of textual data as well as images continue to explode to
the web daily.Current work focuses on Linear Discriminate Analysis, Multinomial Naive Bayes and AdaBoost over Twitter standard
dataset.

# Requirements:

There are some general library requirements for the project and some which are specific to individual methods. 
The general requirements are as follows. 
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib.pyplot`
* `TextBlob`

Software: Jupyter Notebook

Hardware: Using 4GB RAM


# Dataset Creation:

Following are the steps to fetch real-time data from twitter.
•	In order to collect tweets from Twitter, one needs to have a Twitter account. 

•	After logging in to your Twitter account go to Twitter developer settings and follow the steps specified by the developers. 

•	After all the processing is completed, you will get ‘Twitter APIKey’ and ‘APISecret’ key which are needed to be used in python program     to fetch tweets from Twitter. Python provide library named ‘Tweepy’ which is important for processing.

# Result:

1)	Comparison of accuracy. 

2)	Comparison of precision.

# Motivation:

Psychology is a broad domain of study and personality prediction is its integral part. Social media is a most promising platform to determine personality of a person. In the world full of competition, everyone is not able to present his/her views to the world. Hence social media like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram etc. proves most promising solution in this scenario. People express their opinion completely on such platforms without thinking whether they are right or wrong.

# Future Prospects:

Personality is a broad domain and it comes under psychological studies. In this work we have focused mainly on Big Five model of personality prediction which contributes to five categories of personality .There is a scope of research in combining multiple tests of personality to find most accurate class labels. Also more focus can be thrown on real-time data which can have significance with real world. Combining Machine learning algorithms can be useful in improving accuracy. Lastly, there is a scope to work in multimodal approach of prediction in which different biomedical signals can be considered.
