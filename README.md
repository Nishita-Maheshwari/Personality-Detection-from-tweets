# Problem Statement

•	The problem in personality detection is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level.

•	Whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Reason for selecting the topic


•	The project is based on the concept of analyzing the personality of an individual, and plotting the sentiments of tweets according to user/community location.

•	Today's generation personality is most important and personality development goes a long way in reducing stress and conflicts.

•	Personality development helps an individual to inculcate positive qualities like punctuality, flexible attitude, willingness to learn,   friendly nature, eagerness to help others and so on.

•	Personality helps you develop a positive attitude in life.


# Objectives of the project

•	To implement an algorithm for automatic classification of text into positive, negative or neutral.

•	Personality Detection to determine the attitude of the mass is positive, negative or neutral towards the subject of interest.

•	Graphical representation of the sentiment in form of Pie-Chart.

# Literature Survey

•	Efthymios Kouloumpis, Theresa Wilson, Johns Hopkins University, USA, Johanna Moore, School of Informatics University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK in a paper on Twitter Sentiment Analysis: The Good the Bad and the OMG! In July 2011 have investigated the utility of linguistic features for detecting the sentiment of Twitter messages. We evaluate the usefulness of existing lexical resources as well as features that capture information about the informal and creative language used in micro blogging. We take a supervised approach to the problem, but leverage existing hash tags in the Twitter data for building training data.

•	Hassan Saif, Yulan He and Harith Alani, Knowledge Media Institude, The Open University, United Kingdom in a paper Semantic Sentiment Analysis of Twitter in Nov 2012 they have introduce a noval approach of adding semantics as additional features  into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment.

# Future Scope

This is due to the fact that every people post their opinions on a variety of topics,  Discusses current issues, complains and expresses positive Sentiment for Products they use in daily life. Sentimental analysis is the process of deriving the quality information from the text. In other words, it is the process of deriving the structured  data  from  unstructured  data.  This is used to measure opinions of the customer, feedback, product reviews Unstructured data not  only refers to the tables, figures from the organization but also consists of information from the internet i.e. chats,  E-mail, pdfs,  word files,  E-Commerce websites and social networking sites. 
 On structured data analytics operation can be easily performed and the result can be obtained easily. But in case of unstructured data from E-mail, Twitter etc., it is quite difficult to conclude the output because of various problems such as virtual noise effect and unspecific data. In this paper, we look at one such popular micro blog called Twitter.

# Methodology

Methodology of sentimental analysis in twitter mainly involves 5 steps.  

1.	Data Collection.

2.	Pre-processing.

3.	Features extraction.

4.	Feature selection.

5.	Classification.

# Software Required
 
Software: Jupyter Notebook

Hardware: Using 4GB RAM


# Conclusion:

We conclude that using different NLTK classifier it is easier to classify the tweets and more we improve the training data set more we can get accurate results.
